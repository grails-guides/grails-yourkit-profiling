The guide comes built with a simple application created for you.  The purpose of the application is to have ready-made
contrived examples of code which trigger performance issues and cause the tool to display memory, CPU, and heap problems.

The application is titled Grails YourKit Profile and has a simple domain object `Student`. The application has several links
that trigger operations for the purpose of inducing performance issues. In summary, the application has the ability to:

- insert a large amount of students in the database (with random names and grades)
- delete students that have a grade less that an A
- print the students to the screen
- import a spreadsheet of student entries

=== Browse the Code

Please take a moment to browse through the code and familiarize yourself with the important classes of the application.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controller/demo/StudentController.groovy
- Controller which routes to service functionality of insert, delete, print, import.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/Student.groovy
- Domain object used to store a student

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy
- Service which implements the operations of the application

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
- The UI of the application which contains the links of the front page

[source, groovy]
.src/test/groovy/demo/StudentServiceSpec.groovy
- Test class used to validate the functionality of the service. (For convenience)

=== Run the application

Use the command below to run the app. Trigger some of the functionality initially to get familiar. Later we will run the
operation within the context of the profiler.

[source, bash]
