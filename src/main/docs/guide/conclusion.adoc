Performance issues are a bear to identify, troubleshoot and eventually solve. In my experience bottlenecks often show up
with large dataset processing or algorithmic issues.  Tools can only help identify the issue, they cannot interpret the data
for you. By systematically breaking down the problem space, analyzing the code and using a capable toolset, we can forge a smoother
to the solution space.
