In this guide you are going to learn how to profile memory and CPU on a Grails Application.  An application is already created
for you with contrived scenarios that spike memory and CPU parameters. We will examine these scenarios and the associated code
in order to profile memory, CPU, heap and garbage collection. We will then continue to optimize the code and see how it affects
performance.
