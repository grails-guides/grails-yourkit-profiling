The application JVM memory is set `512m`. This is sufficient for a moderate load of xls imports, but will fail as the load
increases. Let's first attempt to import a moderate load of students. Click `Import 25k Students` and observe that the application
is responsive and successfully imports the records.

An increase on the load of import will cause an Out of Memory exception. Before we run into this scenario we must start
profiling.

=== Analyze In Profiler

. Start Object Allocation Recording.

. Proceed to the Memory Tab->Memory & GC Telemetry. Here you can see the live graph of the Heap in real time.

. Execute `Import 75k Students`. Note that processing will occur for a few minutes then Out of Memory exceptions will occur. Upon
the error, YourKit will autogenerate an `.hprof` memory dump file. This is the standard JVM profiling format. Load the file
and click on `Class` and see the first object `Xobj$AttrXobj`.  This class has instances that are exceeding the current JVM Heap
size.

. Now let's `Capture Memory Snapshot`. The snapshot will have a more detailed views and let us pinpoint the problematic areas
of memory usage.

. Go to `Allocations by site`, then `Hot spots by object count`, click on the Method Area (1st item), then
`Back Traces` tab at the bottom right. Expand the trace to see `demo.StudentService.importStudents(String)`. This method is
where the objects are being generated.

=== Examine the Code

The code for `importStudents()` invokes the POI API to load a `WorkbookFactory.` It is at this invocation where the JVM Heap
memory increases significantly. The object instances of `Xobj$AttrXobj`, along with `chars` and `Strings` increase proportionally
with the the size of the `xlsx` file. As a result, the JVM Heap is exceeded.

=== Increase the Memory

This type of memory issue is difficult to track down but fortunately the solution is straight forward. A reasonable increase
in memory will solve the object allocation. No code change is needed. Adjust the file below:
