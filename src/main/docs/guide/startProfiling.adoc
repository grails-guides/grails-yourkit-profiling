There are two ways to bind the profiler to a running application. Either one is preferable:

1. Bind After Application Running
- This type of binding relies on the conventional Grails startup of the application, but at times binding may not be instant
with the attachment or other profiling functions.
- Start the application with the command `grails run-app` or use the Run Configuration in the IDE `Grails: initial`
- Start the YourKit Profiler and in the Monitor Local Applications section, click on the `Application` PID.
- Initiate the binding early in the application startup process for best results.

2. Bind on Startup
- This type of binding results in quicker response times, but requires some startup configuration.
- Create a Run Configuration with the main class `demo.Application`. Be sure to set the `Working Directory` to
`grails-yourkit-profiling\initial`, and also set the `Use of classpath module` to `initial_main`.
- In the `VM Options:` set it to `-Xmx512m -Xms512m`. The VM in this Startup ignores the build.gradle entry.
- Start the application with the pinwheel icon  from your IDE. Since Grails 3 relies on Gradle for its lifecyle management,
in IntelliJ, the pinwheel icon is not active unless you start the application from `Application.groovy`.
