The application prints all the students to the screen in a very inefficient manner. Upon `Print Students`, the application creates
an excessive amount of objects. This results in the JVM overcompensating with garbage collection.

Restart the application with profiling and operate `Insert Students` (2 times) to set up the scenario.

=== Analyze In Profiler

. Start Object Allocation Recording - this is used for memory and garbage collection issues.

. Execute `Print Students`. Observe that print functionality takes a long while.

. Now we must Capture Memory Snapshot. The snapshot will have a more detailed views and let us pinpoint the problematic areas
of garbage collection.

. Navigate to the Garbage Objects Tab, then to the Hot Spots by Object Count. View the Method area and observe the
class `demo.StudentService.printStudents()` method. It is responsible for producing hundreds of thousands GC'd objects.
This is the source of the issue.

. We can also view the Garbage Collection graph that further illustrates the issue. Navigate to the Memory Tab->Memory and GC
telemetry and view the Garbage Collections graph. Notably the garbage collection activity has spiked during the `Print Students`
operation.

=== Examine the Code

The code for `printStudents()` retrieves all the students in the database. It then proceeds to take a string and repeatedly
add it to the the `result` String object. This causes new String objects on every iteration.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy[tag=printStudents]
----

=== Improve the Code

We can improve the code by using `StringBuffer`.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentOptimizedService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/StudentOptimizedService.groovy[tag=printStudentsOptimized]
----

In the `StudentController`, inject `StudentOptimizedService` and replace the `print()` action with the optimized service.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/demo/StudentController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/StudentController.groovy[tag=print]
----

Now that the code improvement is made, we should restart the application with the profiler. Repeat `Insert Students` again. Repeat the steps in
`Analyze in Profiler`. Observe the garbage collection statistics go significantly down.
