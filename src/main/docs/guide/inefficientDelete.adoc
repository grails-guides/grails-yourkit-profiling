The application has inefficient delete functionality. Upon `Delete Students`, the application takes an excessive amount of
time to delete students that have grades less that 90. Let's demonstrate how this can be analyzed with YourKit.

=== Analyze In Profiler

. Start CPU Profiling with Sampling option - this tracks method times with low overhead.

. Execute `Delete Students`. Observe that delete functionality takes a long while. Note the log output to the console has
repeated delete hql statements. Pause for about 2-3 minutes while delete takes place.

. Now we must Capture Performance Snapshot. A snapshot view has much more detailed information than the CPU profile. We
will be able to dig into the performance statistics of the application. The snapshot will capture statistics from the time
the profiler was started till the moment the snapshot was initiated. Once the snapshot is prepared, open it.

. Navigate to Java EE Statistics->Database. Here we can see the excessive amount of delete statements made to the database,
along with the length of time. In the Reverse Call Tree, we can see the application method call responsible:
`demo.StudentService.deleteStudents()`. You may right-click and Open in IDE, which will take you directly to the code.

=== Examine the Code

The code for `deleteStudents()` finds all students less than A grade. It then proceeds to cycle through each object and
issue a delete statement. Obviously this is responsible for the slowdown.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial/grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy[tag=deleteStudents]
----

=== Improve the Code

It is much more efficient to simply issue one delete SQL query with a `where` clause.

We are going to use the http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Service] with a delete operations using JPA-QL:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/StudentService.groovy[tag=deleteStudents]
----

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/StudentDataService.groovy
----
import grails.gorm.services.Query
import grails.gorm.services.Service
import groovy.transform.CompileStatic

@CompileStatic
@Service(Student)
interface StudentDataService {
  ...
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/StudentDataService.groovy[tag=deleteByGradleLessThan]
...
}
----

Now that the code improvement is made, we should restart the application with the profiler. Repeat `Insert Students` again. Repeat the steps in
`Analyze in Profiler` and observe the database `delete` call get reduced to 1.
